## Churn Prediction Case Study
This is a case study concerning churn prediction with a ride-sharing company in San Francisco.

A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. The dataset consisted of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). The latest day of last_trip_date was assumed to be when the data was pulled.

The process for generating the churn prediction model is as follows:

1. Perform any cleaning, exploratory analysis, and/or visualizations to use the provided data for this analysis.

2. Build a predictive model to help determine whether or not a user will be retained.

3. Evaluate the model.

4. Identify / interpret features that are the most influential in affecting your predictions.

5. Repeat until a satisfactory model is found.
